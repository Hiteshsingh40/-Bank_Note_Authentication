Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).
For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out sajalsharma.com
The R portfolio is located here.
Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.
Contents
•	Machine Learning
o	Predicting Boston Housing Prices: A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
o	Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
o	Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
o	Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive: Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
o	Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame
•	Natural Language Processing
o	3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets: 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
o	Cross language Information Retrieval: Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.
Tools: NLTK, scikit
•	Data Analysis and Visualisation
o	Python
